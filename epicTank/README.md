# BOT STRATEGY

## RADAR STRATEGY:
	Basic Lock
		Continuously turn the radar in one direction at maximum speed. 
		When a robot is scanned, immediately reverse the radar direction to keep it locked on the target. 

## MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
	Don't Overthink It
		Move forward until hit a wall, then bounce off and move forward again.
		If hit by a bullet, change direction.

## FIRING STRATEGY:
	Closer = Higher Power; Farther = Low Power
		Adjust firepower based on distance to target
		(or low power if energy is low)
