## MOVEMENT STRATEGY:
	Don't Overthink It
		Every 5 seconds, pick a random direction and move in that direction for 5 seconds. Repeat ad infinitum.
			If hit, move early to avoid getting hit again.

## FIRING STRATEGY:
	Closer = Higher Power Fewer Shots; Farther = Lower Power More Shots
		Calculate distance to target and adjust firepower accordingly. 
		Closer targets receive higher firepower but fewer shots (because they are more likely to be hit by the slower shots),
		while farther targets receive lower firepower but more shots (because the faster shots are more likely to hit than slower shots).
